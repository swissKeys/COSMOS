#serial_interface.rb: Tells COSMOS to use a serial connection.

#/dev/ttyUSB0: This is the device file for the serial connection (adjust as necessary based on your setup).

#9600: This is the baud rate. You will need to know the appropriate baud rate for your sensor. (Adjust this as needed based on your sensor's requirements.)

#NONE: This specifies no parity. This is a common configuration, but you should ensure it matches your sensor's requirements.

#1: This is for one stop bit. Again, adjust based on your device's requirements.
